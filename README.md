# MPhil_Parallel_CUDA_Sparse_Newton_Raphson_Power_Flow
This code shows a parallel (GPU-computing based) implementation of the NR load flow method, including parallel formation of sparse admittance and Jacobian matrices, computation of real and reactive power equations, formation of the linear system of equations and solution of the resultant sparse linear system using a parallel implementation of an iterative Krylov subspace method (Preconditioned Stabilized Bi-conjugate Gradient method
